## Purpose

The purpose of this book is quite similar to creating a compiler-compiler. When a new programming language is 
introduce, the compiler of that language is often written in that language itself. A bootstrap compiler or hand 
compilation is then used to compile a rudimentary compiler of that language. For then, the rudimentary compiler is then 
used to compile a more sophisticated compiler for the language written in the new language itself.

This book holds principals of knowledge transfer, which could be used as a governing artifact for creating both 
software and machine learning artifacts, as a manuscript and a source of truth for aiding further research in machine 
learning.
